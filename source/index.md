# Introduction

The Social Metrics API gives you access to data on various social media platforms including how many times a link has been shared and how many followers a user has.

## Endpoints

The main API endpoint depends on what type of plan you are on. 

Plan	| Endpoint 
------|---------|
Sandbox (FREE) | free.donreach.com
Developer | api.donreach.com
Professional | api.donreach.com
Dedicated | YOURDOMAIN.donreach.com or your own domain.

If you aren't sure which endpoint to use, sign in and visit **My Account**, where all your connection details are listed with your subscription.
